<h1> 133-Snake-Game </h1>
<h3>This is the final project for Professor Ali Ataya's CSC133 at CSUS</h3>
The project is a rework of the classic "Snake" game. The task is to specficially refactor the code such that there are - at minimum - 6 new features that make the game more fun. The code should also abide by clean-code guidlines, while also implementing coding paradigms such as polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and more.
